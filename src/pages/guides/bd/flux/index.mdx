## State management in React
When working with [React](https://reactjs.org), the UI has a state, which determines the elements rendered onscreen.
Changing said state will cause React to rerender the affected UI components.
React itself already comes with some tools to manage state:
the [State API](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html),
which can be used via the [`this.setState()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate) method in class components
and via the newer [`useState()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook in function components.
For managing global state React also features a lesser known [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) out of the box.

However, in large applications state management can prove more difficult or inefficient.
That's what resulted in the [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture for managing data flow and application state in React.
While the original Flux project by Facebook themselves is no longer actively developed, the architecture has proven useful.
Popular state management libraries of today like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) are built upon it.

The Flux pattern traditionally consists of central **Dispatcher**(s), which can receive so-called Actions.
An **Action** represents a modification of the application's state and has an identifying type (kind) as well as a potential payload of additional data.
Actions may also be viewed as events, which happen within the application.
The dispatcher is responsible for forwarding the received data to the relevant **Stores**.
Each store is used to store state information relevant to a specific part of the application.
This allows to separate for example which application language the user has selected from which chatroom they are currently viewing.

You can read more about the architecture in the [In-Depth Overview](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview/) within the Flux Docs.

The store data as well as the ability to dispatch actions now has to be made available for UI components.
For the classic class-based components, this used to be typically done with wrapper components,
which take care of updating and give the inner component access to store data via props or custom methods.
This API is sometimes also referred to as "Connect" since the name of the function used to wrap a component usually includes the word connect.
The alternative API for function component would be realized via the newer concept of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

The React community has been moving more and more towards **function components and hooks**.
They make it easy to use data within a component and have it update automatically.
Libraries like [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) are now recommending usage of their hooks API over older class component APIs.

## Discord's Flux implementation
Discord uses a (as far as we know) custom implementation of the Flux architecture.
It forms a large part of the data layer behind the UI layer.

<Banner type="warn" bold>Named exports have been mangled, which also affects the hooks mentioned below.</Banner>

Their implementation has both a newer hooks API they are transitioning to as well as an old connect API, which is still used in parts of the codebase.
Both APIs require the relevant stores in an array and a callback which computes the data and is invoked whenever a change has been detected.
All hooks also take an optional dependency array.
In the case of `useStateFromStores()` a comparator function can be passed as 4th argument to customize update behaviour.
The `useStateFromStoresArray()` and `useStateFromStoresObject()` hooks come with a predefined comparator for arrays and objects respectively.

<CodeTabs names={["Hooks", "Connect"]}>

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
    const currentUser = useStateFromStores([UserStore], () => UserStore.getCurrentUser());

    return (
        <div>Current user is: {currentUser.username}</div>
    );
};
```

```jsx
const MyComponent = (props) => (
    <div>Current user is: {props.currentUser.username}</div>
);

const ConnectedMyComponent = Flux.connectStores([UserStore], () => ({
    currentUser: UserStore.getCurrentUser()
}))(MyComponent);
```

</CodeTabs>

Their stores as well as their central dispatcher also allow for listeners, which are notified of any incoming actions/events.
This can be useful when you want to use store updates somewhere outside of the UI layer.

```js
const listener = (action) => console.log("Dispatcher received:", action);

Dispatcher.subscribe("ACTION_TYPE", listener);

Dispachter.unsubscribe("ACTION_TYPE", listener);
```

```js
const listener = () => console.log("UserStore was updated");

UserStore.addChangeListener(listener);

UserStore.removeChangeListener(listener);
```

Besides using the intended functions for dispatching specific actions, actions can also be dispatched directly on the dispatcher using `Dispatcher.dispatch()`.

There is a massive amount of different actions.
In May 2022 nearly 1500 entries were listed within Discord's internal `ActionType` TypeScript enum.
The enum has since been removed (most likely turned into a `const enum`) in August 2022.

## Finding Stores
As with all other internals, stores need to be found within the webpack exports cache and have to be reverse engineered.
You can find more information in my [Getting started with BetterDiscord Plugin development](../getting-started) guide.
In 2022 Discord added a `getName()` method to their store class.
The name is also present as `displayName` property on the store constructors.
*(Note: BetterDiscord's `byDisplayName` filter does not search constructors as of now.)*
Theoretically you can now find stores using their name rather than interface or other characteristics.
Store names can also prove useful when figuring out a store's purpose.

<CodeTabs names={["Props", "Name"]}>

```js
const GuildStore = getModule(Filters.byProps("getGuild"));
const ChannelStore = getModule(Filters.byProps("getChannel", "hasChannel"));
const UserStore = getModule(Filters.byProps("getUser", "getCurrentUser"));
```

```js
const GuildStore = getModule((exports) => exports?.constructor?.displayName === "GuildStore");
const ChannelStore = getModule((exports) => exports?.constructor?.displayName === "ChannelStore");
const UserStore = getModule((exports) => exports?.constructor?.displayName === "UserStore");
```

</CodeTabs>

Usually a good way to start is to look at a part of the UI where data from the store you are searching for is supposedly used.
Go up the parent chain and try to find the first "normal" component whose props do not include the data itself or children with the data already "rendered".
The relevant stores are most likely accessed within this component.

Alternatively you can attempt taking educated guesses regarding the store's name or methods - either complete or partial, like `name.toLowerCase().includes("guild")`.

A list of all stores can be retreived by either checking the name or by making sure it is an instance of `Flux.Store`:

```js
getModule(
    (exports) => typeof exports?.getName === "function" && exports.getName().endsWith("Store"),
    { first: false }
)
```

```js
getModule((exports) => exports instanceof Flux.Store, { first: false })
```

Note that the first version will be missing a couple of stores which have no name set.
